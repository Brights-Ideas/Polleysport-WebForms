            <b>Your Privacy</b>

            <p>
                PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE
            </p>

            <p>
                George Polley Motorsports has a firm commitment to privacy. We take your privacy concerns seriously and want to make every effort to address them, that is why we have adopted the following policy, which explains our position on information gathering and disclosure.
            </p>

            <b>Your Personal Information</b>
            <p>
                From time to time, we may ask for information that personally identifies you, as in our user surveys or registration for services such as email, promotions etc. 
We use this information to operate our services and provide you with the highest quality services and offer you opportunities we think will be of interest.
            </p>

            <p>
                We will not disclose any personal information without your advance permission unless we believe the law requires us to do so or the disclosure is necessary to protect the rights or property of George Polley Motorsports.
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and others, we may disclose user information but only in a form that does not identify individual users. For example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of our users are male or within a certain age range if so polled and your permission was requested and agreed to.
            </p>

            <p>
                Occasionally, we may disclose personal information in other circumstances, but we will only do this if we have explained at the time we collect the information the purpose for which it will be disclosed.
            </p>
